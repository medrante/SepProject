# sepproject
for senior design project

## Background
This is supposed to be an app to complement a sensor hardware

Functionalities :
- Add a new sensor
  -- Text to speech (only works on browser for now)
  -- record your message (stretch goal)
- Edit Sensor (TODO)
- Transfer audio file through FTP

## How to run
- make sure you have nodejs, ionic/cli, and capacitor installed
- run ```npm install``` then ```ionic serve``` and watch it spin up on your browser (albeit a little slow)
